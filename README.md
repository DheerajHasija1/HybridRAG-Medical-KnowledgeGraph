# 🏥 Hybrid RAG with Graph Knowledge Integration - Medical Assistant

## 🎯 Problem Statement

This project implements an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines traditional vector search with graph-based knowledge representation to provide contextually aware and relationship-rich medical responses.

## ✅ Key Requirements Implemented

- ✅ **Traditional Vector Search**: FAISS vector database with HuggingFace sentence transformers
- ✅ **Graph-Based Knowledge Representation**: NetworkX knowledge graph with 100+ medical conditions
- ✅ **Hybrid Retrieval System**: Combined vector similarity + graph traversal
- ✅ **Contextual Relationship Understanding**: Medical entity relationships and traversal
- ✅ **Knowledge Graph Construction**: BioRED dataset integration with medical relations

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### **Frontend**
- **Streamlit**: Interactive chat interface with session management
- **UI Features**: Chat history sidebar, conversation persistence, clean medical interface

### **Backend Components**
- **Vector Store**: FAISS with sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings
- **Knowledge Graph**: NetworkX MultiDiGraph with medical entity relationships
- **Hybrid Agent**: Custom retrieval logic combining vector + graph results
- **LLM Integration**: Groq API for response generation

### **Data Sources**
- **Primary**: Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine (PDF processing)
- **Secondary**: BioRED biomedical dataset (100+ medical conditions)
- **Knowledge Base**: Structured medical relations (symptoms, treatments, causes)

## 🚀 Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Vector-Graph Hybrid Architecture**: Designed seamless integration between FAISS vector search and NetworkX graph traversal
2. **Entity Linking & Resolution**: Medical entity extraction using regex patterns and NER pipelines
3. **Multi-Modal Retrieval Scoring**: Combined relevance scoring from vector similarity and graph relationships
4. **Graph Traversal Optimization**: Efficient querying with relationship-based filtering
5. **Embedding Space Alignment**: Coordinated vector and graph representations for medical entities
